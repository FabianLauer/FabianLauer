## Hi there 👋

I’m Fabian. I'm a software engineer and founder of [EYEVIONICS](https://www.eyevionics.com/), a solo venture in flight navigation software for flight simulation.

Here on GH, I mostly keep older side projects around, like an XML Parser I once wrote, or an experiment to integrate a web browser into VS Code.
